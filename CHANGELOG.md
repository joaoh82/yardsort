# Changelog

Notable changes in each release. The [releases page](https://github.com/joaoh82/yardsort/releases)
has the downloads and the full commit lists.

## Unreleased

- **`local` asks what to open.** Clicking a project's own checkout used to open a shell by itself.
  It now offers **Open Terminal** or **Open Composer**, and the composer runs the agent in that
  checkout on the branch you have out — no branch and no worktree are created. It only asks when
  there is nothing running there and nothing to resume. See
  [Projects](docs/guide/projects.md#the-local-workspace).

## 0.5.0

- **Agents keep working when you close Yardsort.** Terminals moved out of the app into a small
  background process (`yardsortd`) that owns them, so closing the window — or Yardsort crashing —
  no longer stops anything. Open it again and every terminal is repainted where it got to, and
  conversations that never stopped are no longer listed as _interrupted_.
- Closing Yardsort with agents still running now asks, naming them: leave them running, stop
  them, or cancel. Leaving them running is the default, and shells are never counted as work.
- The status bar shows the background process, and `YARDSORT_NO_DAEMON=1` turns it off.
- A contact address for questions and support, `hello@yardsort.sh`, on the website and in
  the docs.

## 0.4.0

- **Assist (optional).** With a TypeSafe API key of your own, Yardsort can check a workspace's
  changed files against what the agent was asked to do — badging files that look off-task, or that
  add a secret, weaken a test or switch a check off — and suggest a harness and an effort for the
  message you are typing. Off until you enter a key and tick a feature; the key is kept in your
  system credential store, never in `settings.toml`. Agent output is still never read. See
  [Assist](docs/guide/assist.md).
- Settings → Harnesses gains **Good at**: your own description of what a harness suits, used only
  by Assist's composer suggestion.
- Assist's thresholds — how sure Jev must be before a badge or a suggestion appears — are settings,
  with **Restore defaults**. Changing one re-reads answers already given instead of asking again.
- **Worktrees removed with git are noticed.** Delete a workspace's worktree _and_ its branch
  yourself, and Yardsort marks the workspace **gone** and asks whether to delete it from the app
  too — a "keep" is remembered. See [Workspaces](docs/guide/workspaces.md#when-the-branch-goes-too).
- **Linux AppImage: nothing from the replaced version follows an update.** After updating in place,
  terminals still carried the previous AppImage's `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and friends — the new app is
  started by the old one, so it inherits them — and git kept loading libraries out of the version
  that had just been replaced. Paths into any AppImage's mount are now dropped, not only our own.

## 0.3.2

- Install with Homebrew on macOS: `brew install --cask joaoh82/yardsort/yardsort`.
- Linux: the quick start shows how to give the AppImage a launcher entry and icon.
- Submitted to winget (`joaoh82.Yardsort`), pending Microsoft's review.
- **Linux AppImage: native Wayland.** The AppImage used to run under XWayland, where typing lagged
  and dictation (Omarchy's voice input, anything built on `wtype`) dropped or garbled characters.
  It now opens a Wayland window, and falls back to X11 by itself if that ever fails.
  `YARDSORT_GDK_BACKEND` picks one explicitly.
- **Linux AppImage: terminals get your own environment.** Shells and agents no longer inherit the
  AppImage's private variables (`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `PYTHONHOME`, `GDK_BACKEND`, …), which broke
  `python3` and made git print library warnings.

## 0.3.1

- A changelog (this file).
- First release delivered through the in-app updater: a 0.3.0 install offers it by itself.

## 0.3.0

- **In-app updates.** Yardsort looks for new versions shortly after starting and once a day, shows
  an **Update to x.y.z** button, and installs on request — signed and verified. The macOS app,
  Windows installers and the Linux AppImage update themselves; `.deb`, `.rpm` and AUR installs are
  told a new version exists. See [Updates](docs/guide/updates.md).
- **First-run check.** The welcome screen says whether git and at least one agent were found and,
  if not, how to install them — with **Check again**, no restart needed. The status bar's
  `env: …` indicator re-reads your environment from anywhere.
- Settings → General gains **Check for updates automatically** and **Check now**.

## 0.2.0

- **Renamed from Switchyard to Yardsort.** Projects, workspaces, session history and settings are
  carried over automatically on first launch. New branches are prefixed `ys/`; `sy/` branches
  keep working, as do the `SWITCHYARD_*` environment variables.
- An AUR package, `yardsort-bin`, is prepared and will be published by the release workflow.

## 0.1.0

First public release, as _Switchyard_.

- Projects and workspaces: every task gets its own git worktree and branch.
- Real terminals running the agent of your choice — Claude Code, Codex, Grok, OpenCode, or any
  terminal agent you configure.
- Live list of changed files with diffs, a file tree, and one click into your editor.
- Resume and fork agent conversations; status dots and desktop notifications.
- Rename, archive, restore and delete workspaces, never losing uncommitted work silently.
- Linux, macOS (signed and notarized) and Windows builds.
